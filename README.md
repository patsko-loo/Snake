# Snake
This is your typical Snake game, created with C++ and used SFML to help with keyboard input and graphical output. To play the game, you use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake, and try to eat all the food blocks (In Blue) to grow the length of the snake. You lose the game when you either run into yourself, or run into a wall. The objective is to grow as large as possible without dying! This game lets you adjust several settings when loading the application, such as the snake's speed and how much the snake will grow by when it eats a food block. 
Note: speed is per milliseconds. For example, 0.1 seconds indicate the snake will update every 0.1 seconds.
